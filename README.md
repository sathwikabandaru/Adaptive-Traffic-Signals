# Adaptive-Traffic-Signals
An adaptive traffic signal system that analyzes real-time video to detect vehicle density across four lanes and prioritizes the busiest lane. It also detects emergency vehicles or patients in non-emergency vehicles using RFID and gives them priority. The final signal control is handled via Raspberry Pi.
